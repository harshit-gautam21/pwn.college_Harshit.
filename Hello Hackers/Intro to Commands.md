Linux Commands are case sensitive.
The problem stated that use the hello command to get the flag

## References 
The problem statement was the reference used
```Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.
In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.
